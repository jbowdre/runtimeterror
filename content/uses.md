*Not counting my [homelab](/homelab).*
- **[Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition](https://frame.work/products/laptop-chromebook-12-gen-intel)** (i5-1240P | 32GB RAM | 1TB NVMe). Yep, it's an overpowered Chromebook, and my primary computing device. I make full use of the [ChromeOS Linux Development Environment](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/containers/containers-and-vms/), with [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for package management.

- **[Creality Ender 3 Pro 3D Printer](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-pro-3d-printer)**, or at least that's how it started. It's got a direct-drive conversion, a "silent" board running Klipper firmware, and more printed part upgrades than I can remember.
