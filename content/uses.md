Here's the stuff I use and how I use it.

### Hardware
- **[Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition](https://frame.work/products/laptop-chromebook-12-gen-intel)** (i5-1240P | 32GB RAM | 1TB NVMe). This is my primary personal computing device. Yep, it's an overpowered Chromebook, and I make full use of the [Linux Development Environment](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/containers/containers-and-vms/) to Do Things. I love it.
