title: Fixing 403 error on SaltStack Config 8.6 integrated with vRA and vIDM
---
I've been wanting to learn a bit more about [SaltStack Config](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-automation/saltstack-config.html) so I recently deployed SSC 8.6 to my environment (using vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager to do so as [described here](https://cosmin.gq/2021/02/02/deploying-saltstack-config-via-lifecycle-manager-in-a-vra-environment/)). I selected the option to integrate with my pre-existing vRA and vIDM instances so that I wouldn't have to manage authentication directly since I recall that the LDAP authentication piece was a little clumsy the last time I tried it.

### The Problem
Unfortunately I ran into a problem immediately after the deployment completed:
![403 error from SSC](20211105_ssc_403.png)

Instead of being redirected to the vIDM authentication screen, I get a 403 Forbidden error.

I used SSH to log in to the SSC appliance as `root`, and I found this in the `/var/log/raas/raas` log file:
```

```

Further, attempting to pull down that URL with `curl` also failed:
```shell
curl https://vra.lab.bowdre.net/csp/gateway/am/api/auth/discovery # [tl! .cmd]
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain # [tl! .nocopy:5]
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
```

In my homelab, I am indeed using self-signed certificates. I also encountered the same issue in my lab at work, though, and I'm using certs issued by our enterprise CA there. I had run into a similar problem with previous versions of SSC, but the [quick-and-dirty workaround to disable certificate verification](https://communities.vmware.com/t5/VMware-vRealize-Discussions/SaltStack-Config-Integration-show-Blank-Page/td-p/2863973) doesn't seem to work anymore.

### The Solution
Clearly I needed to import either the vRA system's certificate (for my homelab) or the certificate chain for my enterprise CA (for my work environment) into SSC's certificate store so that it will trust vRA. But how?

I fumbled around for a bit and managed to get the required certs added to the system certificate store so that my `curl` test would succeed, but trying to access the SSC web UI still gave me a big middle finger. I eventually found [this documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Automation-SaltStack-Config/8.6/install-configure-saltstack-config/GUID-21A87CE2-8184-4F41-B71B-0FCBB93F21FC.html#troubleshooting-saltstack-config-environments-with-vrealize-automation-that-use-selfsigned-certificates-3) which describes how to configure SSC to work with self-signed certs, and it held the missing detail of how to tell the SaltStack Returner-as-a-Service (RaaS) component that it should use that system certificate store.

So here's what I did to get things working in my homelab:
1. Point a browser to my vRA instance, click on the certificate error to view the certificate details, and then export the _CA_ certificate to a local file. (For a self-signed cert issued by LCM, this will likely be called something like `Automatically generated one-off CA authority for vRA`.)
![Exporting the self-signed CA cert](20211105_export_selfsigned_ca.png)
2. Open the file in a text editor, and copy the contents into a new file on the SSC appliance. I used `~/vra.crt`.
3. Append the certificate to the end of the system `ca-bundle.crt`:
```shell
cat <vra.crt >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt # [tl! .cmd]
```
4. Test that I can now `curl` from vRA without a certificate error:
```curl
curl https://vra.lab.bowdre.net/csp/gateway/am/api/auth/discovery # [tl! .cmd]
{"timestamp":1636139143260,"type":"CLIENT_ERROR","status":"400 BAD_REQUEST","error":"Bad Request","serverMessage":"400 BAD_REQUEST \"Required String parameter 'state' is not present\""} # [tl! .nocopy]
```
5. Edit `/usr/lib/systemd/system/raas.service` to update the service definition so it will look to the `ca-bundle.crt` file by adding
```ini
Environment=REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```
above the `ExecStart` line:
```ini
# torchlight! {"lineNumbers": true}

ExecStart=/usr/bin/raas

```
6. Stop and restart the `raas` service:
```shell
systemctl daemon-reload # [tl! .cmd:2]
systemctl stop raas
systemctl start raas
```
7. And then try to visit the SSC URL again. This time, it redirects successfully to vIDM:
![Successful vIDM redirect](20211105_vidm_login.png)
8. Log in and get salty:
![Get salty!](20211105_get_salty.png)

The steps for doing this at work with an enterprise CA were pretty similar, with just slightly-different steps 1 and 2:
1. Access the enterprise CA and download the CA chain, which came in `.p7b` format.
2. Use `openssl` to extract the individual certificates:
```shell
openssl pkcs7 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in enterprise-ca-chain.p7b -print_certs > enterprise-ca-chain.pem # [tl! .cmd]
```
Copy it to the SSC appliance, and then pick up with Step 3 above.

I'm eager to dive deeper with SSC and figure out how best to leverage it with vRA. I'll let you know if/when I figure out any cool tricks!

In the meantime, maybe my struggles today can help you get past similar hurdles in your SSC deployments.
