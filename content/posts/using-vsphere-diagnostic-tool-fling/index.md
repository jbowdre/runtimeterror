VMware vCenter does wonders for abstracting away the layers of complexity involved in managing a large virtual infrastructure, but when something goes wrong it can be challenging to find exactly where the problem lies. And it can be even harder to proactively address potential issues before they occur.

Fortunately there's a super-handy utility which can making diagnosing vCenter significantly easier, and it comes in the form of the [vSphere Diagnostic Tool Fling](https://flings.vmware.com/vsphere-diagnostic-tool). VDT is a Python script which can be run directly on a vCenter Server appliance (version 6.5 and newer) to quickly check for problems and misconfigurations affecting:
- vCenter Basic Info
- Lookup Service
- Active Directory
- vCenter Certificates
- Core Files
- Disk Health
- vCenter DNS
- vCenter NTP
- vCenter Port
- Root Account
- vCenter Services
- VCHA

For any problems which are identified, VDT will provide simple instructions and/or links to Knowledge Base articles for more detailed instructions on how to proceed with resolving the issues. Sounds pretty useful, right? And yet, somehow, I keep forgetting that VDT is a thing. So here's a friendly reminder to myself of how to obtain and use VDT to fix vSphere woes. Let's get started.

### 1. Obtain
Obtaining the vSphere Diagnostic Tool is very easy. Just point a browser to https://flings.vmware.com/vsphere-diagnostic-tool, tick the box to agree to the Technical Preview License, and click the big friendly **Download** button.
![Download](download.png)

It will show up in `.zip` format.

### 2. Deploy
This needs to be run directly on the vCenter appliance so you'll need to copy the `.zip` package onto that server. [Secure Copy Protocol (SCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol) is a great way to make that happen. By default, though, the VCSA uses a limited Appliance Shell which won't allow for file transfers. Fortunately it's easy to [follow this KB](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2100508) to switch that to a more conventional `bash` shell:

1. SSH to the VCSA.
2. Execute `shell` to launch the `bash` shell.
3. Execute `chsh -s /bin/bash` to set `bash` as the default shell.


Once that's done, just execute this on your local workstation to copy the `.zip` from your `~/Downloads/` folder to the VCSA's `/tmp/` directory:
```shell
scp ~/Downloads/vdt-v1.1.4.zip root@vcsa.lab.bowdre.net:/tmp/ # [tl! .cmd]
```

### 3. Extract
Now pop back over to an SSH session to the VCSA, extract the `.zip`, and get ready for action:
```shell
cd /tmp # [tl! .cmd_root:1]
unzip vdt-v1.1.4.zip
Archive:  vdt-v1.1.4.zip # [tl! .nocopy:5]
3557676756cffd658fd61aab5a6673269104e83c
  creating: vdt-v1.1.4/
  ...
  inflating: vdt-v1.1.4/vdt.py

cd vdt-v1.1.4/ # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

### 4. Execute
Now for the fun part:
```shell
python vdt.py # [tl! .cmd_root]
_________________________ # [tl! .nocopy:7]
   RUNNING PULSE CHECK

Today: Sunday, August 28 19:53:00
Version: 1.1.4
Log Level: INFO

Provide password for administrator@vsphere.local:
```

After entering the SSO password, VDT will run for a few minutes and generate an on-screen report of its findings. Reports can also be found in the `/var/log/vmware/vdt/` directory.

### 5. Review
Once the script has completed, it's time to look through the results and fix whatever can be found. As an example, here are some of the findings from my _deliberately-broken-for-the-purposes-of-this-post_ vCenter:

#### Hostname/PNID mismatch
```text
   VCENTER BASIC INFO

        Current Time: 2022-08-28 19:54:08.370889

[FAIL]  The hostname and PNID do not match! # [tl! highlight:1]
        Please see https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2130599 for more details.
```
Silly me - I must have changed the hostname at some point, which is not generally a Thing Which Should Be done. I can quickly [consult the referenced KB](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2130599) to figure out how to fix my mistake using the `/opt/vmware/share/vami/vami_config_net` utility.

#### Missing DNS
```text

  dig +short +tcp <fqdn> <nameserver>

Please see KB: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/54682
```
Whoops - I guess I should go recreate the appropriate DNS records.

[INFO]  Number of core files: 15
```
Those core files can be useful for investigating specific issues, but holding on to them long-term doesn't really do much good. _After checking to be sure I don't need them_, I can get rid of them all pretty easily like so:

```shell
find /storage/core/ -name "core.*" -type f -mtime +3 -exec rm {} \; # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

#### NTP status
```text
   VC NTP CHECK
[FAIL] NTP and Host time are both disabled!
```
Oh yeah, let's turn that back on with `systemctl start ntpd`.

#### Account status
```text
   Root Account Check
[FAIL]  Root password expires in 13 days
        Please search for 'Change the Password of the Root User'
        in vCenter documentation.
```
That's a good thing to know. I'll [take care of that](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenter.configuration.doc/GUID-48BAF973-4FD3-4FF3-B1B6-5F7286C9B59A.html) while I'm thinking about it.

```shell
chage -M -1 -E -1 root # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

#### Recheck
Now that I've corrected these issues, I can run VDT again to confirm that everything is back in a good state:

### Conclusion
The vSphere Diagnostic Tool makes a great addition to your arsenal of troubleshooting skills and utilities. It makes it easy to troubleshoot errors which might occur in your vSphere environment, as well as to uncover dormant issues which could cause serious problems in the future.
