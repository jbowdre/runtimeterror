Continuing my mission to *[Tailscale](/tags/tailscale/) all the things!*, I recently added my robot vacuum (a [Roborock S5 Max](https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-s5-max)) to my tailnet.

Okay, installing Tailscale wasn't the *only* thing I did. I also loaded it with software to control it locally so that it no longer has to talk to The Cloud. (And then I installed Tailscale because I can.)

I was inspired to give this a go after reading the [Tailscale sucks](https://tailscale.dev/blog/tailscale-sucks) post on the Tailscale developer blog. That post educated me about a couple of very helpful projects:

- [Valetudo](https://valetudo.cloud/), a web-based front-end for robot vacuums by SÃ¶ren Beye
- [DustBuilder](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/), a custom firmware builder for a variety of robot vacuums by Dennis Giese

Both sites also include a wealth of documentation to guide you along your robot-hacking journey, including a [list of supported robots](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) and a [detailed technical/feature comparison of a variety of robots[(https://robotinfo.dev/).

This post will detail all the steps I took to hack my robot, install Tailscale, configure Valetudo, and get it connected to Home Assistant. (I also semi-live-blogged the process on [social.lol](https://social.lol/@jbowdre/112911333551545789)).

### Getting started
I started by looking at the Valetudo [supported robots list](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) to see that `Rooting [my S5 Max] requires full disassembly.` Clicking through to the [FEL rooting instructions](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/installation/roborock.html#fel) further warned that `This rooting method is not suited for beginners.`.

> Don't threaten me with a good time.

Before getting into the robots guts, though, I went ahead and requested the appropriate firmware so that I wouldn't have to wait on it later.

### Firmware generation
I went to the [Dustbuilder](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/) page,  scrolled until I found the entry for the S5 Max (which also goes by `s5e` in some circles), and clicked to access [that builder](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/_s5e.html).

![Dustbuilder interface showing that I've selected to include an RSA public key for SSH and (importantly) chosen the option to "Create FEL image".](dustbuilder.png)

I generated a new RSA keypair to use for the initial SSH connection:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa-robot # [tl! .cmd]
```

And I uploaded the resulting `id_rsa-robot.pub` to the Dustbuilder interface.

I also made sure to select the `Create FEL image (for initial rooting via USB)` option. Otherwise I left the other options alone, entered a Cloaked email address, and clicked the **Create job** button to kick things off.

### Robot surgery
While my firmware was in the oven I went ahead and began the disassembly process. I started by watching [a disassembly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68flJFSOK8A) but quickly realized that my S5 Max apparently differs from the one being taken apart: after carefully prying off the top cover I found that my robot doesn't have a set of screws surrounding the spinning laser assembly. The inner top cover is a single, solid piece of plastic rather than having a separate cover for the laser.

![The top cover of the robot is a single piece of plastic, without a separate removable piece over the laser sensor.](robot_top.jpg)

So I ditched the video and forged my own path:

1. Remove the dustbin and water basin.
2. Turn robot upside-down.
3. Remove main roller assembly.
4. Unscrew side brush.
    ![The single screw holding the side brush is circled in red.](side_brush.jpg)
5. Unscrew 6 large screws and remove the bottom cover, exposing the battery.
    ![Six large screws circled in red.](6x_bottom_screws.jpg)
6. Unscrew 8 small screws securing the two-piece bumper to the edge of the robot and remove the bumper.
    ![Eight small screws hold the bumper assembly.](8x_bumper_screws.jpg)
7. Disconnect and remove battery.
8. Unscrew 3 small screws holding the side brush motor and remove the motor (my pictures got out of order so I don't actually show the motor removal until much later... please just pretend that I removed it like I said I did).
    ![Three screws hold the side motor assembly.](3x_side_motor_screws.jpg)
9. There are several groups of screws to extract so you can separate the top and bottom halves of the robot:
    1. 2 screws in the battery compartment.
        ![Two screws in the bottom of the battery compartment.](2x_battery_screws.jpg)
    2. 4 short screws near the rear of the robot, where the water basin attaches.
        ![Four short screws near the rear of the robot.](4x_short_screws.jpg)
    3. 1 screw next to one of the main wheel motors.
    4. 1 recessed screw next to the other motor.
        ![Two screws next to the wheel motors.](2x_motor_screws.jpg)
    5. And 8 recessed screws along the robot edges, including one which was covered by the side brush motor.
        ![Eight recessed screws along the edges of the robot.](8x_recessed_screws.jpg)
        ![A screw which was covered by the side brush assembly.](hidden_screw.jpg)
10. Now lift the entire bottom shell to separate it from the top, and flip it over to expose the electronic goodies.
    ![Exposed robot mainboard and other electronics.](top_cover_removed.jpg)
11. Carefully remove the 8 connectors along the front edges of the mainboard; the ones along the rear can stay connected.
    ![Eight electrical connectors along the edges of the mainboard.](8x_mainboard_connectors.jpg)
12. Remove 6 screws from the mainboard.
    ![Six screws securing the mainboard.](6x_mainboard_screws.jpg)
13. Carefully lift the mainboard into a vertical position.
    ![The mainboard lifted perpendicular to the robot body.](mainboard_up.jpg)

That's it! Just 40 screws to be able to access the bottom side of the mainboard, and I was finally ready to launch the attack.

### Launching the hack
I checked my email and found that I had indeed received notification of a successful Dustbuilder build so I downloaded those files:

```shell
ls -l robo* # [tl! .cmd .nocopy:1,2]
.rw-r--r-- 5.3M john  9 Aug 19:02 roborock.vacuum.s5e_1668_fel.zip
.rw-r--r--  28M john  9 Aug 19:00 roborock.vacuum.s5e_1668_fw.tar.gz
```

I also grabbed the [latest `valetudo-armv7-lowmem.upx` binary](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/releases/latest/download/valetudo-armv7-lowmem.upx) from the [Valetudo GitHub](https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/).

And I installed the `sunxi-tools` package needed for communicating with the robot over USB:

```shell
sudo apt update # [tl! .cmd:1]
sudo apt install sunxi-tools
```

I used a micro-USB cable to connect the mainboard's debugging port to my laptop.

![The robot's micro-USB port on the top side of the mainboard.](mainboard_usb.jpg)

![A disassembled robotic vacuum cleaner lying on a desk. There is a laptop computer also on the desk, with code visible on the screen. Several cables and a screwdriver are also visible on the desk. The screen shows code related to the robot vacuum.](laptop_connected.jpg)

And I then connected the robot's battery to the mainboard (but without powering on the robot).

Next came the only truly tricky part of this whole process: shorting the `TPA17` test point on the bottom side of the mainboard to ground, while *also* pressing and holding the power button on the *top* side of the board (it's the button labeled `KEYI3`).

![TPA17 on the bottom of the robot mainboard.](mainboard_tpa17.jpg)

![The robot's power button labeled "KEYI3".](mainboard_power.jpg)

I used my fingernail to gently scrape the coating off the pad to make good contact, and settled on using a bent paperclip for the shunt. I was able to hook one end of the clip through one of the (grounded) screw holes and then only have to worry about precisely placing the other end on `TPA17`, which freed up my other hand for mashing the button.

The technique is to short `TPA17`, press-and-hold the power button for three seconds, and keep `TPA17` shorted to ground for five more seconds after that.

I did that, the status LEDs on the robot came alive, and I went to my terminal to check the status with `lsusb` to see if the `Allwinner Technology sunxi SoC OTG connector in FEL/flashing mode` showed up.

"Okay," I thought to myself, "It must be ChromeOS getting in the way." So I tried my backup laptop (which, admittedly, started as a Chromebook but now runs NixOS). Interestingly, the same thing there - no Allwinner Chicken Dinner.

After half an hour of repeating the same steps and hoping for different results, I had the bright idea to try a different micro-USB cable.

Unfortunately, that didn't change things. So I kept repeating the same steps some more and hoping for different results. Eventually, I tried *another* micro-USB cable, and that seemed to do the trick! ChromeOS prompted me to connect the device to the Linux environment, and `lsusb` then returned the desired result:

```shell
lsusb # [tl! .cmd]
Bus 001 Device 014: ID 1f3a:efe8 Allwinner Technology sunxi SoC OTG connector in FEL/flashing mode # [tl! .nocopy ~~]
```

{{% notice note "\"Universal\" Serial Bus" %}}
I don't have many micro-USB cables left in my house at this point, and most of the ones I do still have arrived as charging cables for various cheap devices. As it turns out, those two other cables I tried first were charging-only cables without any wires to carry the USB data signals.

I had to go digging through my cable drawer to find a quality braided cable (that I knew supported data transfer). If I had just started with a decent cable from the start I could have saved a lot of time and trouble.
{{% /notice %}}

Once I knew that my Chromebook would actually be able to communicate with the robot, I extracted the contents of the `roborock.vacuum.s5e_1668_fel.zip` archive:

```shell
unzip -d fel roborock.vacuum.s5e_1668_fel.zip # [tl! .cmd:2]
cd fel
ls -l
.rw-r--r--  184 john  9 Aug 19:02 activation.lic # [tl! .nocopy:10]
.rwxr-xr-x  66k john  1 Jul  2023 dtb.bin

.rwxr-xr-x 852k john  1 Jul  2023 ub_full.bin
.rw-r--r-- 3.9M john  9 Aug 19:02 uImage
```

And then executed `run.sh` as root:

```shell
sudo su # [tl! .cmd]
./run.sh # [tl! .cmd_root]
waiting for 3 seconds # [tl! .nocopy:4]
100% [================================================]   852 kB,  152.2 kB/s

100% [================================================]     0 kB,   93.2 kB/s
100% [================================================]  3647 kB,  153.6 kB/s
```

After a minute or two the robot rebooted and began broadcasting its own Wi-Fi AP. I connected to that, and then used my RSA key to log in via SSH:

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-robot root@192.168.8.1 # [tl! .cmd]
[root@rockrobo ~]# # [tl! .nocopy]
```

At this point, the robot was temporarily running on a rooted live image with [busybox](https://busybox.net/about.html) to provide a lot of shell functionality; I still needed to install the patched firmware to maintain control though.

I backed up the `nandb` and `nandk` flash partitions, which apparently contain unique calibration and identity data that can't be recovered if I break something:

```shell
dd if=/dev/nandb | gzip > /tmp/nandb.img.gz # [tl! .cmd_root:1]
dd if=/dev/nandk | gzip > /tmp/nandk.img.gz
```

I spawned another shell from my laptop to retrieve those important files:

```shell
scp -O -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-robot root@192.168.8.1:/tmp/nand* . # [tl! .cmd]
```

Back on the robot's shell, I deleted some logs to make sure I'd have enough space to load the new firmware image:

```shell
rm -rf /mnt/data/rockrobo/rrlog/* # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

And used the laptop's shell to transfer over the firmware image:

```shell
scp -O -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-robot roborock.vacuum.s5e_1668_fw.tar.gz root@192.168.8.1:/mnt/data/ # [tl! .cmd]
```

I switched back to the robot session, extracted the firmware package, ran the installer, and rebooted the robot once it was complete:

```shell
cd /mnt/data/ # [tl! .cmd_root:2]
tar xvzf roborock.vacuum.s5e_1668_fw.tar.gz
./install.sh

reboot # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

After the reboot, I reconnected to the robot's AP, logged back in to SSH, and ran the install again, followed by another reboot:

```shell
cd /mnt/data/ # [tl! .cmd_root:1]
./install.sh

reboot # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

I reconnected to the robot's AP once again, and transferred the Valetudo binary to the robot:

```shell
scp -O -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-robot valetudo-armv7-lowmem.upx root@192.168.8.1:/mnt/data/valetudo # [tl! .cmd]
```

And then I logged back into the robot via SSH, cleaned up some of the installation files, configured Valetudo to automatically start at boot, and rebooted once again:

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-robot root@192.168.8.1 # [tl! .cmd]
cd /mnt/data # [tl! .cmd_root:3]
rm roborock.vacuum.*.gz boot.img firmware.md5sum rootfs.img install.sh
cp /root/_root.sh.tpl /mnt/reserve/_root.sh
chmod +x /mnt/reserve/_root.sh /mnt/data/valetudo

reboot # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

I connected to the robot's AP for the last time, and pointed my web browser to `http://192.168.8.1/` to start the Valetudo setup process.

![Valetudo web app prompting the user to scan for and connect to the home Wi-Fi network.](valetudo-wifi.png)

After the robot successfully connected to my Wi-Fi network, I was able to use the [Valetudo Companion Android app](https://f-droid.org/packages/cloud.valetudo.companion/) to easily find the robot on my network. I could then connect to its web interface at `http://192.168.1.172/` and see the fruits of my labor:

![The Valetudo web interface showing a map of my house as well as some information about the robot.](valetudo_map.jpg)

The hack was a success!

### Tailscale time
Needing to find the robot's IP before I can interact with it is kind of lame. I'd rather leverage Tailscale's [MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns) so that I can connect to the robot without knowing its IP (or even being on the same network).

That Tailscale blog post I mentioned earlier offered some [notes on installing Tailscale on a robot vacuum](https://tailscale.dev/blog/tailscale-sucks#:~:text=Getting%20Tailscale%20on%20the%20robot), which I used as a guide for my efforts.

There's plenty (~260MB) of free space on the robot's `/mnt/data/` persistent partition so I logged back in via SSH and did all the work there, starting with downloading the appropriate ARM package from [Tailscale's package server](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static)

```shell
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa-robot root@192.168.1.169 # [tl! .cmd]
cd /mnt/data # [tl! .cmd_root:1]
wget --no-check-certificate https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/tailscale_1.72.1_arm.tgz
```

Then I extracted the binaries, moved them to an appropriate location, and cleaned up the downloaded package:

```shell
tar xvf tailscale_1.72.1_arm.tgz # [tl! .cmd_root:1]
mv tailscale_1.72.1_arm/tailscale \
  tailscale_1.72.1_arm/tailscaled \
  /mnt/data/
rm -rf tailscale_1.72.1_arm* # [tl! .cmd_root]
```

Remember that `/mnt/reserve/_root.sh` script that I copied earlier so that Valetudo would run at boot? I can hijack that to launch Tailscale as well.

Here's the original script:

```shell
# torchlight! {"lineNumbers":true}
#!/bin/bash
if [[ -f /mnt/data/valetudo ]]; then
  mkdir -p /mnt/data/miio/

  if grep -q -e "cfg_by=tuya" -e "cfg_by=rriot" /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf; then
    sed -i "s/cfg_by=tuya/cfg_by=miot/g" /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf
    sed -i "s/cfg_by=rriot/cfg_by=miot/g" /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf
    echo region=de >> /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf
    echo 0 > /mnt/data/miio/device.uid
    echo "de" > /mnt/data/miio/device.country
  fi

  # Delete useless cleanup logs on each boot to enable Valetudo to update itself
  rm -r /mnt/data/rockrobo/rrlog/*REL

  VALETUDO_CONFIG_PATH=/mnt/data/valetudo_config.json /mnt/data/valetudo >> /dev/null 2>&1 &

fi

### It is strongly recommended that you put your changes inside the IF-statement above. In case your changes cause a problem, a factory reset will clean the data partition and disable your chances.
### Keep in mind that your robot model does not have a recovery partition. A bad script can brick your device!
```

See that note at the bottom? Sounds like a good idea, so I'll put my Tailscale code inside the existing `if` statement:

```shell
# torchlight! {"lineNumbers":true}
#!/bin/bash
if [[ -f /mnt/data/valetudo ]]; then
  mkdir -p /mnt/data/miio/

  if grep -q -e "cfg_by=tuya" -e "cfg_by=rriot" /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf; then
    sed -i "s/cfg_by=tuya/cfg_by=miot/g" /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf
    sed -i "s/cfg_by=rriot/cfg_by=miot/g" /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf
    echo region=de >> /mnt/data/miio/wifi.conf
    echo 0 > /mnt/data/miio/device.uid
    echo "de" > /mnt/data/miio/device.country
  fi

  # Delete useless cleanup logs on each boot to enable Valetudo to update itself
  rm -r /mnt/data/rockrobo/rrlog/*REL

  VALETUDO_CONFIG_PATH=/mnt/data/valetudo_config.json /mnt/data/valetudo >> /dev/null 2>&1 &

  # tailscale # [tl! **:7 ++:7]
  if [[ -f /mnt/data/tailscaled ]]; then
    mkdir -p /mnt/data/tailscale-state /tmp/tailscale
    STATE_DIRECTORY=/tmp/tailscale /mnt/data/tailscaled \
      --tun=userspace-networking \
      --socket=/tmp/tailscale/tailscaled.sock \
      --statedir=/mnt/data/tailscale-state > /dev/null 2>&1 &
  fi

fi
```

I rebooted the robot, then reconnected and logged in to Tailscale, also setting a custom hostname and enabling [Tailscale SSH](/tailscale-ssh-serve-funnel/#tailscale-ssh) along the way:

```shell
/mnt/data/tailscale --socket=/tmp/tailscale/tailscaled.sock \
  up --ssh --hostname=derpmop # [tl! .cmd_root:-1,1]
```

Now I won't have to keep up with the robot's IP address anymore; I can just point a browser to `http://derpmop.tailnet-name.ts.net/`. I can also SSH in without having to specify a key since Tailscale is handling the authentication for me:

```shell
ssh root@derpmop # [tl! .cmd]
```

### Home Assistant integration
