title: Burn an ISO to USB with the Chromebook Recovery Utility

There are a number of fantastic Windows applications for creating bootable USB drives from ISO images - but those don't work on a Chromebook. Fortunately there's an easily-available tool which will do the trick: Google's own [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm) app.

Normally that tool is used to creating bootable media to [reinstall Chrome OS on a broken Chromebook](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595) (hence the name) but it also has the capability to write other arbitrary images as well. So if you find yourself needing to create a USB drive for installing ESXi on a computer in your home lab (more on that soon!) here's what you'll need to do:

1. Install the [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm).
2. Download the ISO you intend to use.
3. Rename the file to append `.bin` on the end, after the `.iso` bit:

4. Plug in the USB drive you're going to sacrifice for this effort - remember that ALL data on the drive will be erased.
5. Open the recovery utility, click on the gear icon at the top right, and select the *Use local image* option:

6. Browse to and select the `*.iso.bin` file.
7. Choose the USB drive, and click *Continue*.

8. Click *Create now* to start the writing!

9. All done! It probably won't work great for actually recovering your Chromebook but will do wonders for installing ESXi (or whatever) on another computer!
![Success!](-lp1-DGiM.png)

You can also use the CRU to make a bootable USB from a `.zip` archive containing a single `.img` file, such as those commonly used to distribute [Raspberry Pi images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/chromeos.md).

Very cool!
